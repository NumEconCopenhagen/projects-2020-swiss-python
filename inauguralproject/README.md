# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Inaugural_Swiss_Python.ipynb](Inaugural_Swiss_Python.ipynb).

The project 0 / inaugural project was a first python hands-on exercise by solving an economic model and presenting the results.

The economic model is a simple labor-supply model, where economic agents maximize their consumption and labor supply under the constraint that labor supply or more precisely the income from labor is taxed. Defining the several model specific functions and solving it with a loop we find results that go hand-in-hand with economic intuition: 

Optimal labor supply and consumption are increasing in wage, except at the cut-off point where income-taxes are increased (as here, the disutility of labor supply becomes larger than the marginal net benefit from consumption of the higher income). Moreover, the total revenue of taxes is higher when the Frisch-elasticity of labor supply is lower. 

Last but not least, a tax revenue maximization function also finds optimal values for the standard labor income tax, the top bracket labor income tax and the cut-off for the top labor income bracket.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
