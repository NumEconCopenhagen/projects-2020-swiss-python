# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **OLG-Model** and is about solving and visualizing the standard Overlapping Generations Model. Moreover, we extend the model by introducing a government and looking at the difference of financing the state budget by tax and bond.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [OLG.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
