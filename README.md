# Welcome to the NumEconCPH repository from swiss-python

A short description of the projects:

- **inauguralproject:** The structure is as follows: it contains a jupyter notebook where all the results are presented. The project can be seen from running [Inaugural_Swiss_Python.ipynb](inauguralproject/Inaugural_Swiss_Python.ipynb). In this project we solved a simple labor-supply model and visulaized the optimal outcome. 

- **dataproject:** Same structure as above. The project can be seen from running [dataproject/PS_Data_Project_Coronavirus.ipynb](PS_Data_Project_Coronavirus.ipynb). We loaded, aggregated and visualized the coronavirus cases data provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). 

- **modelproject:** Same structure as above. The project can be seen from running [XY](modelproject/OLG). We solved and visualized a standard OLG model. Furthermore, we extended it with a government and looked at the effect of tax and bond financing of the budget.
